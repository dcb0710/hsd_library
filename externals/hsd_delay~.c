 This is a basic delay-line, implemented with a ring-buffer. It constantly writes the incoming samples to an array (with a samplewise increasing write-pointer). Simultaneously, a read-pointer reads out the samples written to the array before. The offset between the write pointer and the read pointer is determined by the delay-time. When the pointers reach the end of the array, they are "wrapped" to the start of the array, thus the pointer is set to the value 0.

 To allocate memory for a huge array as it is used here, the function "getbytes()" from m_pd.h is used. It reserves a certain amount of bytes and returns a pointer to the start of the array. This pointer is stored in the *delay_line and can be accessed like a regular array. It is important to keep track of the size of the array.
    -> for resizing: the length of the delay line depends on the sample rate. So everytime the sample-rate of pd changes, the delay line need to have another length and has to be resized. This is done by the function "resizebytes()", which needs the the new AND the old number of bytes
    -> for deallocating: it is very important to free the memory allocated with "getbytes()" at the end of runtime, because puredata wonÂ´t do it by itself. for this purpose, a free-function has to be defined (hsd_delay_free()). This function is passed with the "class-new"-function call. It is called when puredata shuts down or the object is deleted. Here you can call the function "freebytes()"
 
 The offset of the pointers is calculated with the delay-time in ms (-> sr*delay_ms / 1000). If the offset is a noninteger value, the read-pointer has to read the next possible two integer values and interpolate between them to generate the output sample.
 
 
 The delay-line introduced here is used in other hsd-externals and can be used for further development.
